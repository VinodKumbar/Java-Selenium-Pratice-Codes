 The Java Collection Framework is a collection of interfaces and classes, 
 which helps in storing and processing the data efficiently.
  This framework has several useful classes which have tons of useful functions which makes
  programmer task super easy.
  
  1.LIST
    A List is a Ordered Collection (sequence). 
    List may contain Duplicate Elements
    
    Below are classes implement List Interface 
    a. ArrayList
    b. LinkedList
    c. Vector
  
  2.SET  
    A Set is a collection that cannot contain duplicate elements 
    However it makes no gurantees concering the order of iteration
   
    Below are classes implement List Interface 
    a. HashSet
    b. LinkedHashSet
    c. TreeSet
  
  3.MAP
    A Map is an object that maps Keys to Values. 
    Map can not contain Duplicates keys
    
    Below are classes implement List Interface 
    a. HashMap
    b. LinkedHashMap
    c. TreeMap
    
    ******************************* difference between HashMap and HashTable*****************************************
    
    1. Synchronization or Thread Safe : This is the most important difference between two.
    
    HashMap : is non synchronized and not thread safe.
    HashTable : is synchronized and thread safe. 
    
    Which means, if multiple program simultaenously access HasMap, then HashMap its keep updating that means 5 diffrent programs or therads can access HashMap in sametime
    
    In case of HashTable if one programm acessing it, other program has to wait till first programm release the HashTable resources.
    
    2. Null Keys and Null Values : 
    
    HashMap : allows One Null Key and (any) 'n' number of Null Values in the HashMap object.
    HashTable : does not allow Null Keys and Null Values in the HashTable obejct
    
    3. Iterating the Values:
    
    HashMap : HashMap obeject values are iterated by using iterator
    HashTable : HashTable is the only class other than Vector which uses enumerator to iterate the values of HashTable object.
